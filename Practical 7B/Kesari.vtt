00:00:46.700 --> 00:01:06.500
Extracted by NARACHI.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.210
At the beginning of the 19th century,
Maharaja Ranjit Singh drove away

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.540
the Afghans from the North-Western region
of India and established Sikh Rule there.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.670
Since then,
the Prince of Afghanistan kept looking out

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.370
for an opportunity to capture
this part of India again.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.480
After the Maharaja's death,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.160
when the British tried to
strengthen their hold on the region,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.710
they suffered heavy losses
at the hands of the Afghan tribes.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.530
It was also said that
there was a Mullah...

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.400
who would incite the Pathans to
attack the British in the name of Jihad.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.770
Since it was only the Sikhs
who could oust the Afghans,

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.200
the British took the help of the
Sikh Armed Forces to fight the invaders.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.500
In 1890, the 36th Sikh regiment
was stationed at the three forts built...

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.690
amidst the Samana Mountains.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.440
This is the story of the
soldiers from this very regiment,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.810
who were guarding the Saragarhi Fort.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.230
These mountains fall under Afghanistan.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.940
And these belong to India.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.080
And in the middle, a line is drawn.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.230
And proclaimed as a border.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.230
- This?
- Hmm.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.890
Now let's suppose,
the Englishman is the husband...

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.390
And the Ruler of
Afghanistan is the wife...

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.770
And the Pathans of this
region are the Magistrate.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.020
The wife took the husband's money...

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.970
And accepted this line as the border.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.930
So if the husband and
wife are in agreement...

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.600
what's the magistrate's problem?

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.790
The magistrate always
has a grouse with the regime.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.350
On top of that,
the wife keeps egging him on...

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.560
So the Afghan Prince is instigating
the Pathans against the British...

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.640
But why?

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.310
Because the wife wants
to continue her Russian affair...

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.930
divorce the husband
and grab the alimony!

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.930
And only the magistrate
can sanction the divorce.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.860
Ishar Singh...

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.480
But if the Prince is the wife,

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.180
The Englishman is the husband...

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.060
And the Russian is the lover...

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.480
Who are we, then?

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.860
The wedding guests!

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.140
Gulab Singh, we're the wedding procession.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.480
We're just here to dance to their tunes!

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.666
Havaldar (Sergeant) Ishar Singh!

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.690
Yes Sir.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.690
We're done patrolling today.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.390
Time to head back to Gulistan.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.880
Keep the men ready.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.560
Yes Sir.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.180
- Sir, look!
- No, Ishar Singh!

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.270
We won't interfere in their matters.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.730
- Sir, they'll kill her!
- So what?

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.520
It's business as usual for them.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.390
Not our problem.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.020
Come on, move!

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.730
That's an order, Havaldar!

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.560
Havaldar!

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.930
Lord Almighty, uphold our honour.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.640
Oh dear.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.190
It's showtime!

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.420
Run...

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.300
Run away!

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.680
The Sikhs carry their
honour in their turbans...

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.770
Take it off first.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.350
Strip his head bare
before you chop it off.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.560
Kill me if you want,

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.010
but don't dare touch my turban.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:09.430
One shall be forever blessed,
who says God is the ultimate truth!

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.100
He needs to be punished severely, Sir.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.130
We need to set an example.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.560
You are right, Lawrence.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.350
This is a serious matter.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.930
We must inform the Lieutenant
Colonel immediately.

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:13.520
- Attar Singh!
- Yes Sir!

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.100
Make contact with Saragarhi.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.700
We need to send a message to Lockhart.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.810
For Lieutenant Colonel Haughton.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:19.890
Yes Sir!

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.180
Water is already scarce.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:39.520
If the Major finds out you've
been watering the earth it,

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.350
he'll shoot you straight-away.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:43.480
It's my share of water.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:45.810
Whether I drink it or throw it -

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:47.520
my wish!

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.730
Any progress?

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:53.980
Not yet.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.100
Nothing can grow here, Ishar...

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.770
This soil is as hostile as the Pathans...

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.730
It refuses to mingle with strangers.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.930
I'm a farmer, Gulaab...

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.180
Bonding with the earth
comes naturally to me.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.770
So, have they decided on my punishment?

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.390
Not yet...

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.310
He'll poison the Major's ears first...

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.430
Then they'll send word to Haughton Sir.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.640
He's going to deal with you then.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.520
Haughton Sir won't do anything to me.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.270
He's very different from Lawrence Sir.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:36.640
How exactly?

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.640
Haughton Sir doesn't discriminate
on the basis of a man's colour.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:41.480
Right.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.130
Whether you're white, brown or any colour

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:45.690
for him, all soldiers are equal.

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:47.390
All that is rubbish.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.496
If that were the case, why would
he differentiate between you and I?

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.790
Because we're separated by rank.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:53.700
That's why.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.730
Man, I want to rise in rank too!

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:58.100
Learn some English first, Gulabo!

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.230
Yeah right...

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:00.930
As if you've learnt a lot, eh?

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.600
I have! By listening to them.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.560
You barely know a few words...

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.320
God knows if you even use them correctly!

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.180
I know a lot of words.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:12.980
I learn a new one everyday.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:13.600
Right.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:17.640
Do you remember the day when troops
arrived from Hangu... With General Biggs?

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:18.500
Yes.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.326
Among them was a British
Havaldar (Sergeant).

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:22.470
- Yeah, yeah.
- The same rank.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:24.800
Do you know what they called him?

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.640
What?

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.680
"Saajan (Darling) Tim, Saajan Tim!"

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:29.430
- Saajan?
- Hmm!

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:31.060
God, no...

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.366
I don't want to be a Havaldar then!

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:33.770
Why, what happened?

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.180
Look, there are 175 men here.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.640
If they all start calling
me 'Darling Gulaab'...

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.600
My masculinity will be blown to bits!

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.680
Well, Nurse Teresa will
call you 'Darling' too, then...

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:47.600
Won't you be thrilled!

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.430
Oh stop it, Ishar Singh!

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.890
What do I say, my friend...

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.310
Every time a war begins...

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.180
I wish to get injured...

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.600
Only so the pretty nurse
could tend to my wounds.

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.010
But nothing ever happens!

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:06.810
The Pathans can't even aim -

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.390
Gulabo!

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:39.230
Nurse!

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:42.270
Look after him.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:44.640
There's too many of them, Sir!

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.230
Send word to Lockhart.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.640
Call for help. Quick!

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:48.730
Yes Sir!

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.480
Buddy..

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.970
Why didn't you obey
Lieutenant Lawrence's orders?

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:59.310
If I had,
that girl would have been killed.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.770
Yes, she would've died...

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:04.430
But we wouldn't have been attacked!

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:09.890
You just gave that
Mullah another excuse...

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.100
To rile up the Pathans against us.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:14.430
I beg your pardon, Sir...

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:17.390
But the reason behind this war isn't me...

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:20.230
It's the British government.

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:23.390
Don't you dare teach me about
the politics of my government.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.020
You're a soldier,
meddling in politics isn't your job.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.770
Your job is to follow orders.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.810
I'm transferring you.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.730
You're going to Saragarhi
and taking charge there tomorrow.

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.350
Sir, what will I do there?

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:43.700
Nothing ever happens there.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.350
Yes. That's why.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.740
So you won't get into trouble over there.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:50.350
And remember.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:55.860
Without Saragarhi,
Gulistan and Lockhart can't communicate.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:58.980
I'm a soldier, Sir...

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:00.560
Not a postman.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:04.730
Be careful Ishar Singh,
or you won't remain a postman either.

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:19.770
Havaldar!

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.380
Havaldar!

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.480
Yes Sir.

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.570
When you see a senior officer,
what are you supposed to do?

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.440
I didn't ask you to salute.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.600
I simply asked you -

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.020
what should you do when you see me?

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:58.150
I should salute you, Sir.

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:01.440
Then why didn't you?

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.640
I see.

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:11.980
Looks like I need to teach
you some discipline, Havaldar.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.150
Now salute thrice.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:23.230
And with each salute,
apologize to your senior officer.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:31.900
Right now, Havaldar!

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:46.400
I'm sorry, Sir.

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:51.230
I'm sorry, Sir.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.520
I'm sorry, Sir.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.940
What did you think, Havaldar?

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.150
You'll disobey me and get away with it?

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:11.160
You think you're better than me, isn't it?

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:13.860
Well, let me tell you something.

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:16.690
If you were better than us...

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.200
You wouldn't be our slaves.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.860
You know, it's funny.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:28.070
The Sikhs and Pathans
claim to be very brave...

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:32.190
But the moment there's a chance,
you're the first to flee.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.400
Like now...

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.360
You're running off to Saragarhi.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:39.940
That's how the people of India are.

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.930
I think there's something
rotten in this land itself...

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.110
It breeds cowardice.

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.520
Am I right, Havaldar?

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.440
I'm sorry. Don't let me keep you.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.690
You need to pack your bags.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.400
So long, f***er!

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:16.110
'Fakhar' (Pride)?

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.230
On one hand, he's angry...

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:24.940
And yet, he's proud of you too?

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.420
I'm confused.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.820
These Britishers are such weirdos, man!

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:40.480
He says the cowards are
born from the land of our country.

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.400
These forts stand on our shoulders...

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.230
And they have the gall to call us cowards,
the low-lives!

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:54.390
Why didn't you answer back?

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.190
I don't know why...

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.440
Words seemed to fall short.

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.150
Man, don't you ever wish...

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:20.150
We could flow free, like a river...

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:23.820
Walk with pride and swagger...

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:26.110
March to our own beat?

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.900
What are you talking about, Ishar?

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:31.440
I don't really understand.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.980
Today, for the first time I realized...

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:42.900
We're slaves, not soldiers.

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.190
Were people like us just

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.190
born to bow and salute?

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.610
First the Mughals ruled us,

00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:59.480
now the British...

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:02.020
When will we rule ourselves?

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.020
So you want to rule, is it?

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:09.070
I want to be free...

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.020
To be free like a river...

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.190
To flow of my own accord.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.690
Anyway, forget that.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:28.980
Tell me something...

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.970
Did she finally nurse your wounds?

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:35.770
How would I know -

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:38.020
I was unconscious!

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:40.980
My luck is cursed.

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:44.190
I took a bullet, all in vain!

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:46.440
Why don't you get married?

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.900
I will when I go back to my village next.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.860
It's better than getting
shot for a random woman...

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:57.190
I'll just remember my wife,
and soothe my heart.

00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:58.610
Like you do.

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:01.420
What do you mean?

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.150
Don't act so innocent...

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:07.620
I've often seen you sitting and
thinking of her, smiling to yourself.

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:10.320
You sure keep an eye on me, eh!

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.400
Very well. I'll leave now.

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:22.860
Stay strong, my friend.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.230
Take care of yourself.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.240
Holy smokes!

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:00.940
It's you!

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:02.940
I thought it's someone else.

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:06.680
Hello.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.320
Hello.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.610
Are you fine, ma'am?

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:13.990
I hope nobody troubled you again?

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:18.820
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:22.020
Do you know Punjabi?

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.070
Hindustani?

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:28.900
No point asking.

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:32.300
Do you know English, ma'am?

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.600
Engli...

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.970
One-two-three,
left-right, left-right, fire, line...

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:38.050
Bye-bye...

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:39.150
Bye-bye!

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:41.320
Wow... 'bye-bye'?

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:44.150
By God, you speak English!

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:45.730
Amazing.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.050
Do you know any more?

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:53.650
No?

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.730
Very well. I'll be off then.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.720
Pardon?

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.040
Yes, yes.

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:56.710
What is this?

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:10.900
Hmm... It's sweet.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.610
It's very tasty.

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:28.630
It was nice talking to you.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.110
I'll be off now. May God be with you.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.200
Bye bye.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.570
Are you done philandering?

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.920
Bless you, my love!

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.610
Such anger!

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:16.150
I look after your home,
await your return years on end...

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.320
While you get cozy with that Pathani!

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.280
Why fight as soon as you've arrived, love?

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.650
At least offer me a few sweet words!

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:26.320
You satisfied your sweet tooth,
didn't you? Tell me!

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:28.730
I'm going to crush your bones.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.610
Wait till you get home.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.820
She offered me sweets
as a token of gratitude...

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.630
So I had to accept it.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:38.860
You know I'm not fond of sweets anyway...

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:42.980
I like it hot and spicy...

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.900
That's why I married you!

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.426
You're not all that good looking,
you know...

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:52.170
It's just these silly things
you say that make me fall for you.

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:56.240
So when I come home,
will you just crush my bones...

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:58.760
Or will we get cozy too?

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:02.860
I say, Mister Ishar Singh...

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:04.440
Yes, sweetheart...

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:06.020
Go to hell.

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:12.340
Okay, forget romance...
At least give me a hug!

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:14.360
I'll die a happy man!

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:16.000
My love!

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.560
Stop.

So should I write this, then?

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:32.820
"I miss you a lot."

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:36.360
Oh no. Let it be, Gurmukh.

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.690
She'll have the priest read it to her.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.230
If she hears these words from him...

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:43.520
she'll be mortified, the poor thing!

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:48.610
Just write this much, that I'll -

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:00.440
It's a letter from Haughton Sir.

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:03.190
I'm taking charge
of this place from today.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.330
But weren't you going to arrive tomorrow?

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.240
I'm Naik (Corporal) Lal Singh
and that's Sepoy Gurmukh Singh.

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.560
Lamp Operator.

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:18.030
So you have kids enrolled in the army!

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.350
How old are you, kiddo?

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:20.530
Nineteen, Sir.

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:27.530
Who's making so much noise?

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.410
Attention!

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:55.030
Attention!

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:01.870
Attention, soldiers!

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:04.020
Havaldar Ishar Singh
is here to take charge.

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:13.990
Sir, water.

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:16.950
Who are you?

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:18.780
I'm the cook. Khuda Daad.

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:23.330
No thanks.

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:30.220
So these are the brave
men of the 36th Sikh cavalry.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:38.700
Is this what soldiers are like?

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:42.010
No Sir.

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:45.290
Actually,
nothing much happens around here...

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.001
All we do is pass on messages
from Gulistan to Lockhart...

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:49.660
Back and forth.

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:52.320
You could say it's like a post office.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.910
This is the army, Lal Singh.

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:56.180
Not a festive carnival!

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:02.450
Look at the state of your men!

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:05.240
Where's your uniform?

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:09.910
Worthless creatures!

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:13.870
Drop the broom!

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.340
Look.

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:22.160
A soldier in underwear!

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:25.870
Look at Gurmukh!

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:30.250
A soldier must be in uniform on duty!

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:33.870
Bloody Brit!

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:36.530
You'll be punished for this.

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:40.620
Now you'll wrestle among yourselves,
and the roosters will watch the show!

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.120
And you'll continue
till the roosters ask you to stop.

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:47.820
But...

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:49.920
How will the roosters speak?

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:51.470
Who are you?

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.760
Lance Naik Chanda Singh, Sir!

00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:59.510
Chanda Singh...

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:02.870
While they wrestle,

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.430
you'll take rounds of the fort.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.120
Understood?

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:11.530
Yes Sir.

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:13.620
Lal Singh.

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:15.130
Yes Sir.

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:19.450
Your duty is

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:23.080
to keep a watch on them.

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:26.160
If anything goes wrong in the slightest,

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:29.780
you'll be punished.

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:30.870
Yes Sir.

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.330
And remember

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:35.920
you'll only do as the roosters say.

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:39.560
Get the birds!

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:50.460
You went on a rampage as soon as
you arrived! Why were you so hard on them?

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.040
My love...

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:56.580
This regiment was named after the Sikhs.

00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:58.750
Its name carries our repute and honour.

00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:01.210
One mistake from them can
malign not just the regiment...

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:03.870
But the name of our entire community.

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:07.250
But the roosters won't speak, will they?

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.210
They won't.

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:10.920
So then?

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.290
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:18.330
Adversity reveals one's
true character, isn't it?

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.000
What is it?

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.290
When you say such clever things,

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:49.000
I feel so...

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:52.170
Don't you have any work to do?

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.960
Go, feed the cattle!

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.500
I've already fed them.

00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:58.370
I just need to feed your mother now.

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:07.210
Don't talk nonsense.

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.580
Do you want a spanking?

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:11.790
Oooh...

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:14.500
Go right ahead, my love!

00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:16.920
At least you'll touch me then.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.250
Hush, you naughty girl!

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.290
What's happening?

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:31.830
I asked them to wrestle
and they're singing instead.

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:45.960
Lal Singh!

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.080
Yes Sir.

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:53.680
Where are the roosters?

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:56.420
We cooked them, Sir.

00:42:57.090 --> 00:42:58.090
On whose orders?

00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:59.620
The roosters' orders!

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:01.290
What nonsense is this?

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:04.500
Sir, you told us to
do as the roosters say.

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:09.420
They didn't say 'Stop!',
but they definitely told us to cook.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:10.880
They spoke to you?

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.420
That's what,
at first we didn't understand either.

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:16.080
They were speaking in English, Sir!

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:22.040
The roosters spoke in English?

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:23.540
Yes Sir.

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:25.710
Jeevan Singh!

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:35.960
Tell Sir what they said.

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:53.420
Sir, among all of us,
only Gurmukh knows English.

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:57.650
He told us what 'Cook'
means in English, so...

00:43:58.900 --> 00:43:59.990
We did exactly that, Sir.

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:05.790
Who was responsible for carrying
out the punishment properly, Lal Singh?

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:07.920
I was, Sir.

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:11.550
So then you'll be one getting punished.

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:16.210
Forget chicken,
you'll get nothing to eat for a week.

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:18.390
Yes Sir.

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:20.330
Pardon me, Sir...

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:24.380
But as long as Naik Lal Singh doesn't eat,
we won't either.

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:38.960
Alright.

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.790
Actually, let's extend
the punishment to two weeks.

00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:43.670
Okay?

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:46.330
Two weeks, Sir?

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.400
Should I increase it?

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:51.920
Any doubts?

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:52.950
No, Sir!

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:57.410
36th Sikh Regiment, any doubts?

00:44:57.490 --> 00:44:59.290
No, Sir!

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:01.170
Well done.

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.420
"Cook-a-doodle doo!"

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.420
There he goes again!

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:43.410
Man, if he couldn't get married...

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:45.120
How is it our fault?

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:49.540
Well, if a man gets called to the battlefield
right before his wedding night...

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:51.750
He's bound to be upset.

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:54.120
Poor guy's stuck being a virgin...

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.530
Yeah, as if you have tons of experience!

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.400
O Bholeya!

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.170
What's the only battle you can never win?

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:15.790
Do you know? Tell me?

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.210
Marriage!

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:19.540
No matter what you do,
the wife always wins!

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:27.210
Lighten up, man...

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:33.080
I told you, he won't laugh.

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:35.420
He will, someday!

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:39.830
Took rounds of the fort all night...

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:44.080
Didn't sleep, and wouldn't let us either!

00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:48.330
Not sure if he's a man or a bloody ghost.

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:40.890
Definitely a ghost!

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:49.120
Give it a break, man!

00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:52.740
Polish that shoe any more,
and a Genie will emerge from it!

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:55.740
You won't understand, Ram!

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.150
I know...

00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:01.740
You're saving them for your father.

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:06.150
These aren't just shoes,
they're my father's dream.

00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:09.740
The poor man has worn one pair of
torn slippers all his life.

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:12.240
He always loved the shoes soldiers wear...

00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:15.610
That's why he enrolled me in the army!

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:20.280
Now when I take these
gleaming shoes for him...

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:21.860
You'll see.

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:25.570
He'll be so happy,
he'll even wear them to sleep!

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:27.690
Weirdo!

00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:49.030
What's with him and our undies?

00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:58.740
Bholeya!

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:02.400
Shall I tell you a joke?

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:04.070
Once, a...

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:08.430
Lighten up, man...

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.180
What does he think of himself?

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:28.070
What kind of punishment is this?

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:31.440
If a soldier remains hungry,
how will he fight?

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:36.820
Sir, I don't get a good
feeling about this man.

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:39.650
The British have sent us a liability.

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:44.070
Mark my words.
This man will get us killed one day.

00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:46.440
We were at fault, Chanda.

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:48.030
We deserved to be punished.

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:49.940
Don't get so angry.

00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:51.370
Let it go.

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:52.900
Look at this.

00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:56.610
Look, your niece is now six months old!

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:57.860
See!

00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:05.360
She has such tiny hands!

00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:10.650
Man... Enough, for God's sake!

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:12.910
Stop playing these morose tunes now.

00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:14.990
Come, spend your wedding
night with me if you want!

00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:30.320
Have you lost it!

00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:38.150
Gentlemen...

00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:44.010
Till now, each of your tribes
have fought the British separately...

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:46.760
Which is why they have failed.

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:50.550
But now it's time to stand united.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.480
Because now,
it's not merely a border-related matter.

00:50:55.850 --> 00:51:00.240
Some days ago, that Britisher
along with his Sikh infidels

00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:05.130
stopped us from punishing
a woman who insulted Allah's name.

00:51:06.010 --> 00:51:07.510
Blasphemy!

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:15.000
The day is not far, when they'll
tell us to let our women roam unveiled...

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:19.050
The way their women do. God forbid!

00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:27.470
There's still time...

00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:31.880
We need to protect our women,

00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:35.960
our traditions, our faith...

00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:41.380
We have to destroy
them or we'll be destroyed.

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:45.410
We...

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:50.180
We need to fight a holy war...

00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:53.840
Jihad.

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:59.680
I agree that we must stand united,
Mullah Saeedullah...

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:04.800
But before making any decision,
I want to know where the Sheikh is?

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:08.550
Sheikh Abdul Rehman is
the Ruler of Afghanistan...

00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:11.710
The British always keep an eye on him,

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:13.740
so it wasn't possible
for him to be here today.

00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:17.540
We have no problem with his absence.

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:22.630
Our only issue is that
the British pay us money...

00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:25.630
To not attack their convoys.
What about that?

00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:28.380
If we succeed,
you'll get double the amount.

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:29.750
And the border?

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:31.300
It'll be erased.

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:40.090
It's a deal.

00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:48.610
8, 9, 10...

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:54.880
11, 12,13, 14...

00:52:56.050 --> 00:52:57.180
Do you know,

00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:00.090
the pantry has 312 potatoes,

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:04.260
221 onions and 150 carrots...

00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:06.800
And a sack of watermelons.

00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:09.010
How many tomatoes?

00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:12.090
How does it matter?

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:15.300
It's not even been two days...

00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:19.680
Yes, Khuda Daad...

00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:21.260
You called me, Sir?

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:22.560
Listen...

00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:24.540
Make food for everyone.

00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:26.090
The punishment is over.

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:28.090
Yes Sir!

00:53:32.090 --> 00:53:35.220
Everyone get ready to eat!

00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:37.130
Sir has called off the punishment!

00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:52.220
Hold on!

00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:54.680
No one's going to eat.

00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:57.760
Sir, we're going to
complete the punishment.

00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:59.730
The punishment is over, Chanda.

00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:01.720
Come quietly and eat.

00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:02.800
No Sir.

00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:04.470
We don't need his pity.

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:07.130
Two weeks means two weeks.

00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:09.090
Understood?

00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:19.630
You are wise men.

00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:22.090
You must have a good reason to rebel.

00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:24.130
But you must know that.

00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:27.080
Sir hasn't eaten in two days as well.

00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:52.130
Sir, why are you punishing yourself?

00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:59.130
To eat while my comrades stay hungry?

00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:02.470
I'm not such a soldier, Lal Singh.

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:05.130
Alright, Sir.

00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:08.180
Let's all eat together, then.

00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:12.800
Khuda Daad!

00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:14.010
Yes Sir.

00:55:15.130 --> 00:55:17.570
Go on, 'cook' the chicken!

00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:18.300
Yes Sir.

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:19.760
And make it quick.

00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:54.600
So it's decided then.

00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:57.240
The first attack will be on Saragarhi.

00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:00.730
The Sikh troops are
few in number over there.

00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:03.020
Won't take much time to finish them off.

00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:08.480
And then Gulistan and Lockhart...

00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:13.440
won't be able to contact
each other for help.

00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:15.270
And by evening,

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:24.150
our flag will be flying
on all three forts.

00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:27.720
What if other troops
come to Saragarhi's rescue?

00:59:27.930 --> 00:59:29.480
Our army will stop them.

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:34.560
The large British forces from
Hangu will also surely come to help them.

00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:36.870
It will be difficult to stop them.

00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:39.270
They'll only be able to
reach the next day from Hangu.

00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:44.560
That's why it's imperative that we seize
control of Gulistan and Lockhart by evening.

00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:49.350
Once we do that,
no army will be able to drive us out.

00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:51.560
With Allah's will, it will happen.

00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:54.390
This time, both the numbers
and God are in our favour.

00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:57.150
Why do you keep getting God into this?

00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:00.310
What does He have to do
with human war and bloodshed?

01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:04.600
Wars aren't fought without weapons...

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:07.560
You use yours...

01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:10.230
And let me use mine?

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.040
Sir, 'Fakhar'?

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:24.460
Your English is pretty good...

01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:26.500
You must know what it means!

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:27.680
Pick that up too.

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:30.170
Sir, at first I didn't understand either.

01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:33.330
I heard the word for
the first time in Peshawar.

01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:35.580
From an English officer.

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:36.580
He told me what it means.

01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:38.800
Skip the long story and come to the point.

01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:41.510
Tell me what it means!

01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:59.100
Ishar Singh!

01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:06.790
What in God's name is he doing?

01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:08.750
Bloody Lawrence!

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.380
You're a Fakhar!

01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:11.980
Your Dad's a Fakhar!

01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:13.620
Your Brother's a Fakhar!

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.780
Your whole goddamn family are Fakhars!

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:16.860
Sir...

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:19.540
- Scoundrel!
- Sir...

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.960
- Son of a donkey!
- Sir...

01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:23.190
What is it?

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.400
- What is it?
- Sir...

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:30.660
Sir, if you go towards
the northern wall and shout,

01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:32.170
you'll be heard in Gulistan.

01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:34.540
Sound echoes in all directions from there.

01:01:42.930 --> 01:01:43.930
What are you looking at?

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:50.210
You go and do your work.

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:52.270
Actually, that's what I came for, Sir.

01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:53.290
Tell me.

01:01:53.370 --> 01:01:55.210
We have an informer
in the village down there.

01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:57.580
He hasn't come back in a while.

01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:00.270
Something seems wrong, Sir.

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:02.710
We should go and find out.

01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:36.170
Welcome!

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:37.830
Please come in.

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:40.290
Thank you.

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.120
How may I serve you?

01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:44.540
I'd like some tea, please.

01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:46.080
Surely, sir!

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:51.210
Mohsin left the village overnight.

01:02:51.790 --> 01:02:52.460
Why?

01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:55.500
Everyone found out that he's an informer.

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:57.420
His life was under threat.

01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:04.170
Where are all the
villagers carrying stones?

01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:06.500
Winter is coming, Sir...

01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:10.630
We need to finish all the village
repairs before it begins to snow.

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:14.500
But I only see women,
children and elderly folk...

01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:17.170
This is heavy labour...

01:03:17.890 --> 01:03:19.170
Where are all the young men?

01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:22.200
They're all out for battle.

01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:27.120
Only if they get a break from
war can they think of home, right?

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.250
Thank you.

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:34.980
You didn't go?

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:37.000
I've lived long, Sir...

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:40.330
Long enough to understand
that these wars and borders...

01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:42.960
It's all just business.

01:03:45.250 --> 01:03:46.960
What are you repairing these days?

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.380
Give us a job that befits a soldier, Sir.

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:56.130
We are here to fight the Pathans.

01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:57.950
Not to build their mosques!

01:03:58.030 --> 01:04:00.330
We'll fight when the time comes...

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:02.830
We surely will, Chanda Singh.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:07.420
But now is the time to build God's home.

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:09.856
And we have no grudges with God, do we?

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.380
The Pathans wouldn't piss
on us if we were on fire, Sir.

01:04:12.670 --> 01:04:14.420
We've been enemies since centuries.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.580
We won't accept this, Sir.

01:04:21.730 --> 01:04:23.450
You can give us any
punishment you deem fit.

01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:24.670
This is service.

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.210
It must be done voluntarily, not by force.

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:31.500
Whosoever wishes,

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.170
can join me tomorrow morning.

01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:37.710
But before you make up your mind...

01:04:38.110 --> 01:04:39.800
Do remember the name of the person...

01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:42.920
who laid the foundation stone
of the Sri Harminder Saheb Gurudwara.

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:51.130
Whoever laid it

01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:52.470
how do we care?

01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:54.580
Why bother thinking of it?

01:04:55.330 --> 01:04:56.330
Right?

01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:58.670
But who was it, after all?

01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:00.710
The Sufi Muslim Saint, Hazrat Mian Mir.

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:04.920
Our Guru Arjan Dev Ji requested
him to do the honours.

01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:17.290
May I battle all foes without fear.

01:05:18.350 --> 01:05:26.030
And claim victory with courage.

01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:33.690
May I battle all foes without fear.

01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:41.150
And claim victory with courage.

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:50.460
And claim victory with courage

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:56.460
Grant me this boon, O God.

01:05:56.540 --> 01:06:02.230
May I never refrain from righteous acts

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:09.860
Grant me this boon, O God.

01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:15.690
May I never refrain from righteous acts.

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:54.190
You're late, Lal Singh!

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.290
Pardon my audacity, Sir -

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.770
but we're right on time!

01:06:59.110 --> 01:07:03.860
If we were late,
you would be crushed to a pulp!

01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:05.750
Come on, boys.

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:10.900
So, what needs to be done?

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.070
This way...

01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:17.780
Slowly.

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:19.070
Straight, straight...

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:21.110
Yes...

01:07:22.650 --> 01:07:24.100
Move it...

01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:25.990
Okay.

01:07:26.070 --> 01:07:27.500
Slowly.

01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:30.180
Slowly.

01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:31.710
Wait.

01:08:27.010 --> 01:08:28.280
God bless you!

01:08:49.530 --> 01:08:50.530
Daya Singh,

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:52.130
granny gave everyone an almond.

01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:54.050
And everyone ate it.

01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:58.000
But Bhola has been guarding
it like some prized possession!

01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:00.340
We all crave for
something in life, Jeevan.

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:03.340
For some, it's power,
for some it's just respect.

01:09:05.190 --> 01:09:06.386
Granny didn't just give him an almond,

01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:08.000
she gave him respect, from the heart.

01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:09.960
I don't quite understand.

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.460
In our society...

01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:16.170
A man's caste dictates whether
he is treated as a human or animal.

01:09:17.050 --> 01:09:20.130
And people like Bhola Singh
were always considered animals.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.250
I was with him in Lahore.

01:09:22.790 --> 01:09:24.880
I heard that as a child...

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:27.680
he once stole mangoes
from the landlord's orchard.

01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:30.670
He paid the price,
with both his childhood...

01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:34.210
and his mother's honour
crushed at the landlord's feet.

01:09:35.950 --> 01:09:40.000
The truth is, our Gurus
always considered everyone equal.

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:42.960
But we as a society
never truly accepted this.

01:10:05.170 --> 01:10:06.380
Baldev Singh!

01:10:06.690 --> 01:10:07.800
Yes Sir!

01:10:14.170 --> 01:10:15.650
Sir, there's a message from Lockhart.

01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:16.890
What is it?

01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:33.910
Sir, they're warning us.

01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:35.616
A group of Pathans
is approaching Saragarhi.

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:37.300
He says they are sending troops for help.

01:10:39.210 --> 01:10:40.210
Lal Singh.

01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:42.460
Get me my monocular.

01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:43.550
Yes Sir!

01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:51.160
Why can't I see them?

01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:54.710
Do you think they turned towards Gulistan?

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:57.590
It's possible.

01:10:59.610 --> 01:11:01.830
Let's contact Gulistan, then.

01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:31.780
There's a message from Lieutenant
Colonel Haughton, Sir.

01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:42.700
Soldiers, there are at
least 10,000 of them out there.

01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:45.490
And there's 21 of us.

01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:49.900
Orders have arrived from Lockhart...

01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:56.940
And a soldier's duty is to obey
his officer unquestioningly.

01:14:58.190 --> 01:14:59.190
But...

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:03.190
But today I want you to
make this decision for yourselves.

01:15:04.570 --> 01:15:06.570
What are Lieutenant Colonel
Haughton's orders, Sir?

01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:16.400
They cannot come to help us.

01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:19.380
Because the pathans
have blocked all the routes.

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:23.070
So they've asked us to
abandon the fort and escape.

01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:43.690
Bhola, what's the matter?

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:45.650
They're asking us to run!

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:49.360
We should flee!

01:15:57.390 --> 01:15:58.780
Soldiers!

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:02.410
I know how you feel about this.

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:08.270
But I still want you to think again.

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:14.420
You're putting a lot
more than your lives at risk.

01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:20.400
So give it some more thought.

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:24.010
I always knew it...

01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:28.440
A man who keeps preaching
love and humanity...

01:16:28.530 --> 01:16:30.370
- How can he fight a war?
- Chanda Singh, you -

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:34.740
Why are you trying
to weaken our resolve, Sir?

01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:37.740
Why don't you just admit...

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:41.110
That you're scared
seeing so many Pathans.

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.740
You don't want to
fight this battle, Sir!

01:16:52.290 --> 01:16:53.820
I'll fight, Chanda Singh.

01:16:54.850 --> 01:16:56.070
I most definitely will.

01:16:56.150 --> 01:16:58.780
But I want us to first think...

01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:01.330
what are we fighting for?

01:17:03.490 --> 01:17:06.940
For the salaries
that we get every month...

01:17:07.730 --> 01:17:09.070
For this uniform...

01:17:09.150 --> 01:17:13.360
Or for the British
who are in fact, our oppressors?

01:17:13.710 --> 01:17:16.610
Can you sacrifice everything
you have for them?

01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:18.690
I cannot.

01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:22.690
Absolutely not.

01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:27.470
My life, relationships
and responsibilities...

01:17:27.650 --> 01:17:29.730
are far more precious to me.

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:40.440
Then what will you fight for...

01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:42.830
Sir?

01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:48.280
Tell us!

01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:23.580
- What nonsense is this, Chanda Singh?
- I'm speaking the truth, Sir!

01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:25.810
I told you the very first day...

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.626
The British sent us a liability,
not a leader.

01:18:27.650 --> 01:18:29.910
A man who goes around building
mosques for the Pathans...

01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:31.450
Who will he fight for?

01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:37.070
And you guys were happy
singing his praises!

01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:40.450
Went ahead building
the Pathans' mosques...

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:41.780
Now see the result!

01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:45.410
See for yourselves, what a coward he-

01:19:32.590 --> 01:19:35.320
Do you know why I've
worn this saffron turban?

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:40.280
An Englishman once told
me - You're a slave.

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:44.200
That cowards are born in our country.

01:19:46.610 --> 01:19:48.950
Today's the time to answer back.

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:56.900
Do you understand what
saffron symbolizes, Chanda Singh?

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.490
It's the colour of bravery.

01:20:02.370 --> 01:20:03.700
Of sacrifice.

01:20:06.150 --> 01:20:08.030
We've sacrificed millions of lives...

01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:12.650
and earned the right
to wear this colour on our heads.

01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:18.080
Today when I go to battle
thousands of enemies...

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.860
With my head decorated
and held up high...

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:21.570
I won't be alone.

01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:26.900
I'll carry the spirit of all those
brave men who gave up their lives...

01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:29.780
but not their honour.

01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:34.400
Today I'll fight, not for money...

01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:37.570
Not for the British...

01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:40.150
Not for myself...

01:20:41.950 --> 01:20:44.070
But for those martyrs.

01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:48.530
For every man who
is considered a slave.

01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:50.990
For my community.

01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:53.740
Today I'll fight for my Guru...

01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.200
Today, the turban I wear is Saffron...

01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:58.820
I will bleed Saffron,

01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:01.360
And my fight-back will also be Saffron!

01:21:02.850 --> 01:21:09.360
One shall be forever blessed,
who says God is the ultimate truth!

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:15.430
One shall be forever blessed,
who says God is the ultimate truth!

01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:21.890
One shall be forever blessed,
who says God is the ultimate truth!

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:28.990
There's just 21 of them!

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:50.650
Don't worry...

01:23:51.190 --> 01:23:52.820
We're very far off.

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:55.110
The bullet can't reach here.

01:24:19.410 --> 01:24:20.570
Sir...

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:23.550
I didn't know the gun
could fire that far!

01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:24.990
It can.

01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:28.600
If the wind blows
in the same direction.

01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:33.350
Forces, get ready to attack!

01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:43.560
Jeevan Singh, Uttam Singh.

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:46.690
Yes, sir!

01:24:58.770 --> 01:25:00.640
36th Sikh!

01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:03.140
Get into position!

01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:11.600
What happened, Gurmukh?

01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:13.350
Sir, I had a question.

01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:14.700
Ask away.

01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:22.310
I know Haughton Sir
ordered us to stay here.

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:25.020
Why did you lie to us?

01:25:27.170 --> 01:25:28.560
For our freedom, Gurmukh.

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:29.710
Freedom, Sir?

01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:33.520
The British call us slaves, Gurmukh.

01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:40.200
A slave can neither live
nor die of his free will.

01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:43.480
If I told you the truth...

01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:48.560
It would be said that 21 soldiers
of the British army fought bravely.

01:25:49.610 --> 01:25:52.890
But today these 21 Sikhs have
chosen to die of their own accord...

01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:55.310
Not because a white
man ordered them to.

01:25:57.270 --> 01:26:01.690
That's why today,
21 Sikhs shall fight as free men...

01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:05.850
and die as free men.

01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:18.510
Sir!

01:26:18.690 --> 01:26:19.690
Yes, Khuda Daad.

01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:23.390
You think I won't fight against them,
because I'm a Pathan?

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:25.600
When did I say so?

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:29.440
You said there's 10000 of them,
and 21 of us.

01:26:29.890 --> 01:26:31.140
There's 22 of us, Sir!

01:26:31.530 --> 01:26:32.560
I'll also fight.

01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:40.060
Don't go by my stature.

01:26:40.330 --> 01:26:41.440
I'm stronger than I look.

01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:43.480
I can shoot as well.

01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:46.060
Many people can shoot a gun,
Khuda Daad.

01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:51.100
But the job I'm giving you,
is something only you can do.

01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:52.310
What's that, Sir?

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:55.440
You'll offer water
to every wounded soldier.

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:58.560
But I've always done that.

01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:01.950
But you've probably never
offered water to the enemy.

01:27:03.310 --> 01:27:04.550
To enemy soldiers?

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:07.230
Till he fights, he's an enemy soldier.

01:27:07.730 --> 01:27:11.480
When he falls wounded,
he's just a thirsty man.

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:14.690
Sir, I want to destroy our enemies,
not save them!

01:27:16.650 --> 01:27:17.650
Daad...

01:27:19.530 --> 01:27:22.270
In the battle of Anandpur Saab,
Bhai Kanhaiya Ji offered water...

01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:25.600
to the injured Mughal
soldiers as well as the Sikhs.

01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:28.690
When the Guru asked him why...

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:31.480
Do you know what he said?

01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:33.060
What, Sir?

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:39.050
"I see God in all men, whether
it's our soldiers or theirs."

01:27:39.550 --> 01:27:41.100
"How can I not serve Him?"

01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:44.770
Fighting only destroys the enemy.

01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:47.730
Kindness destroys enmity itself.

01:27:48.650 --> 01:27:51.850
I'm giving you the chance to
be the bravest soldier in this battle.

01:27:52.110 --> 01:27:54.510
If you have the courage, take it.

01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:10.230
Bring it on.

01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:32.140
Attack!

01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:43.810
- After Saragarhi, they will attack here.
- Sir! It's started!

01:28:52.830 --> 01:28:53.830
God help them.

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:08.850
Hold!

01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:27.690
Today, either you'll screw
them or they'll screw you...

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.480
Either way,
your wedding night is guaranteed!

01:29:43.250 --> 01:29:48.780

01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:12.990
Fire!

01:32:56.580 --> 01:32:57.950
It's a bomb!

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.280
Bhagwan Singh!

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:43.830
Bhagwan Singh!

01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:46.280
Nand Singh, lie low!

01:34:07.290 --> 01:34:08.910
Screw you!

01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:11.350
Nand Singh!

01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:19.620
Bhagwan!

01:34:34.090 --> 01:34:36.560
Nand Singh! Come on.

01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:37.660
Stand up...

01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:12.160
Bhagwan Singh!

01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:15.370
Bhagwan...

01:35:17.570 --> 01:35:18.860
Bhagwan...

01:35:20.250 --> 01:35:21.620
No need...

01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:25.620
No need to show such sympathy,
Nand Singh.

01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:31.430
With the sad songs
you've been singing...

01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:34.720
you won't survive either,
you idiot!

01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:40.390
- Buddy...
- Yes.

01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:43.810
My mother...

01:35:44.810 --> 01:35:48.540
She will be left all alone, man!

01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:50.600
Bhagwan...

01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:05.080
Nand Singh.

01:36:06.430 --> 01:36:07.430
Nand Singh!

01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:09.460
Yes Sir!

01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:12.100
Are you okay?

01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:14.070
Yes Sir.

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:16.700
Go, handle the front.

01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:18.780
The battle isn't over.

01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:22.360
Those bloody...

01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:37.150
Why didn't you shoot, Gurmukh Singh?

01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:41.110
Why didn't you shoot, Gurmukh Singh!

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:44.400
Sir I...

01:36:44.530 --> 01:36:45.530
You what?

01:36:46.650 --> 01:36:47.780
What?

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:49.240
I...

01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:51.200
I got scared, Sir!

01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:53.320
I got scared.

01:36:55.110 --> 01:36:56.950
I've never killed anyone.

01:36:58.320 --> 01:36:59.380
Never fought a battle.

01:37:00.530 --> 01:37:02.570
I got nervous, Sir.

01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:16.950
Go take Bhagwan Singh inside,
and return to the Lamp.

01:37:18.370 --> 01:37:21.070
And make sure Haughton Sir
is updated on every detail.

01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:23.490
Go.

01:37:23.570 --> 01:37:24.570
Yes Sir.

01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:31.160
Sir...

01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:33.450
There's a message from Saragarhi.

01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:35.900
Bhagwan Singh has been martyred.

01:37:58.330 --> 01:38:02.960
[BHAGWAN SINGH]

01:38:25.530 --> 01:38:26.860
Ram Singh!

01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:27.960
Yes Sir.

01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:29.570
You take Bhagwan Singh's place.

01:38:29.650 --> 01:38:32.120
But there'll be no one
left to guard the western front.

01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:34.650
They'll get here only if
we let them cross from there.

01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:35.450
Come on.

01:38:35.530 --> 01:38:36.530
Yes, sir!

01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:43.030
Destroy them in Bhagwan Singh's name!

01:39:04.490 --> 01:39:05.520
Cease fire.

01:39:06.750 --> 01:39:07.820
Stop firing!

01:39:28.830 --> 01:39:29.720
Sir.

01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:30.960
Yes, Gurmukh.

01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:34.360
Haughton Sir has said that General Biggs
has set off from Hangu with his batallion.

01:39:34.730 --> 01:39:35.990
They'll reach by tomorrow.

01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:41.790
Lal Singh!

01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:44.140
This seems to be
a ruse of theirs, Sir.

01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:46.150
We're just playing along, Lal Singh.

01:39:46.230 --> 01:39:47.230
How, sir?

01:39:47.610 --> 01:39:50.120
General Biggs will arrive
with his forces tomorrow.

01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:53.310
The longer this battle continues,
the better.

01:39:53.470 --> 01:39:57.410
Now if they want to waste
time in talking, what's the harm?

01:39:57.490 --> 01:40:01.150
So if we manage to stop them till
tomorrow, will they reach here to help us?

01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:03.400
Even if they can't help us...

01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:06.650
they'll be able to
help Gulistan and Lockhart.

01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:10.270
The Pathans will definitely
attack there as well.

01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:15.320
So the longer we can stop them,
the better it is for our comrades.

01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:45.530
I'm Khan Masood.

01:40:46.030 --> 01:40:47.210
The leader of the Afridis.

01:40:48.700 --> 01:40:51.860
That's Gul Badshah,
the leader of the Orakzais.

01:40:53.150 --> 01:40:55.530
And that's Mullah Saeedullah,
our guide.

01:40:57.990 --> 01:40:58.990
That's Ram Singh.

01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:00.320
Tell me.

01:41:00.610 --> 01:41:03.810
Look, it's clear that
you cannot win this battle.

01:41:05.950 --> 01:41:09.240
We won the moment we decided to fight.

01:41:10.450 --> 01:41:13.910
The rest is mere bloodshed;
It will go on.

01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:16.450
- None of you will...
- Wait, Sir.

01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:19.420
Excuse me.

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:21.400
- Khuda Daad.
- Yes Sir.

01:41:33.450 --> 01:41:34.490
You were saying something.

01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:38.410
These antics of yours won't save you.

01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:40.990
You have only one chance to survive.

01:41:41.070 --> 01:41:43.410
Ask Allah for forgiveness, and leave.

01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:45.740
Or you'll get killed.

01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:49.780
We're ready, Sir.

01:41:49.860 --> 01:41:53.610
Do you have the courage
to die for your cause...

01:41:54.700 --> 01:41:56.680
Or can you only kill innocent women?

01:42:40.990 --> 01:42:44.820
If you lay down your arms,
we'll let you leave safely.

01:42:47.130 --> 01:42:50.070
There's a thin line
between bravery and madness.

01:42:50.460 --> 01:42:54.610
You got 10000 men to fight 21,
and you talk of bravery?

01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:42.360
If you want to fight, so be it.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.670
A dying man must be
granted his last wish.

01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:47.820
Fight bravely, Gul Badshah.

01:43:48.530 --> 01:43:49.700
The British are watching.

01:43:50.590 --> 01:43:54.240
Or they'll say cowards
are born from this land.

01:43:54.580 --> 01:43:56.780
You take great pride in your bravado,
isn't it?

01:43:57.380 --> 01:44:00.490
Well, our pride is
what we're fighting for.

01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:03.610
By noon today,
Your pride shall be destroyed.

01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:09.160
You'll fall at our feet
and beg for your lives.

01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:13.570
After Saragarhi, we'll have Gulistan
by afternoon and Lockhart by evening.

01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:16.950
Today we'll conquer all three forts...

01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:21.110
And the proud turbans of
the Sikhs will be at our feet.

01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:29.410
Dream on!

01:44:34.740 --> 01:44:35.740
Wait.

01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:40.780
Uttam Singh!

01:44:53.610 --> 01:44:55.740
You've lost a lot of men.

01:44:57.280 --> 01:44:58.860
You must be falling short.

01:44:59.870 --> 01:45:01.160
So I'm returning them to you.

01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:14.300
Move it!

01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:33.700
By the time the walls come down,
we should try and get to the doors.

01:45:34.290 --> 01:45:36.070
They are wooden -
they'll break quickly.

01:45:36.670 --> 01:45:38.740
The enemy won't survive
a two-pronged attack.

01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:41.990
That Sardar talks too much!

01:45:44.620 --> 01:45:46.320
We need to make him
realize our strength -

01:45:57.820 --> 01:45:59.570
Take that!

01:46:16.570 --> 01:46:17.860
Soldiers!

01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:24.780
They claim that...

01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:31.110
First Saragarhi,
Gulistan and by evening, Lockhart...

01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:35.780
They think that in 9 hours,

01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:39.240
they'll capture all three.

01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:47.770
They think that we'll fall
at their feet and beg for our lives.

01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:54.700
They think our turbans
will be crushed under their feet.

01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:59.210
What do you have to say to that?

01:47:03.810 --> 01:47:05.910
Screw you!

01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:12.240
Come down!

01:47:12.930 --> 01:47:14.200
Come down!

01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:17.090
Come down, my man...

01:47:17.170 --> 01:47:20.000
If the Pathans shoot,
you'll lose your manhood...

01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:22.010
along with your life!

01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:28.840
I say, let's drop these British rifles,
and get our Indian shooters out!

01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:31.310
The enemy will flee
out of embarrassment!

01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:34.830
Someone shoot that infidel!

01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:47.990
36th Sikh!

01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:50.530
No matter what...

01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:54.000
we must stop them here till evening.

01:47:59.950 --> 01:48:02.050
Stay strong, brothers!

01:50:21.450 --> 01:50:22.680
Bhagwan Singh!

01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:31.800
Gurmukh!

01:50:33.130 --> 01:50:34.190
Gurmukh!

01:51:09.780 --> 01:51:10.780
Lal Singh!

01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:12.260
Yes Sir!

01:51:12.340 --> 01:51:14.100
Go down and guard the door!

01:51:14.180 --> 01:51:15.180
Now!

01:51:15.650 --> 01:51:17.740
Sunder, Daya, Hira, Jeevan, Bhola...

01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:18.820
Let's go!

01:51:18.980 --> 01:51:19.980
Let's go!

01:53:27.970 --> 01:53:29.360
Bhola!

01:53:29.670 --> 01:53:31.400
Bhola!

01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:32.860
Bhola!

01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:35.070
Bhola!

01:53:38.090 --> 01:53:39.110
Bhola!

01:53:39.190 --> 01:53:41.420
I was out of rounds, Sir...

01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:43.320
so they shot me down.

01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:44.430
Quiet, Bhola.

01:53:44.510 --> 01:53:45.900
Get a cloth from inside.

01:53:46.050 --> 01:53:47.890
Let it be, Sir.

01:53:48.580 --> 01:53:54.390
They say death washes away
all divisions and differences.

01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:55.950
Shut up, Bhola!

01:53:56.030 --> 01:53:57.030
Today,

01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:02.630
I feel like I'm truly equal...

01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:04.940
Sundar, get some cloth here, quick!

01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:06.440
Like everyone else.

01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:07.530
Bhola...

01:54:07.610 --> 01:54:09.520
Keep faith!

01:54:10.370 --> 01:54:11.440
It's okay...

01:54:12.780 --> 01:54:14.180
Stop it.

01:54:14.260 --> 01:54:15.260
Sir.

01:54:27.220 --> 01:54:31.060
Jeevan, you've become a fossil!

01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:32.860
Your Pop's a fossil!

01:54:57.400 --> 01:54:59.010
My rounds are over, Sir.

01:54:59.090 --> 01:55:00.270
Mine too!

01:55:00.890 --> 01:55:03.400
Sir, I also have only one left.

01:55:04.060 --> 01:55:05.400
What do we do?

01:56:52.340 --> 01:56:53.810
Bring the marksmen forward!

01:56:54.650 --> 01:56:56.940
Sundar!

01:56:58.240 --> 01:56:58.910
Heere!

01:56:58.990 --> 01:57:01.460
Jeevan! Take them inside...

01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:03.060
I'll collect the ammunition.

01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:30.690
Jeevan, close the door!

01:57:59.290 --> 01:58:03.270
Jeevan, close the door!

01:59:50.990 --> 01:59:51.990
Bhola...

01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:57.240
Shall I tell you a joke?

02:00:17.370 --> 02:00:18.370
Sir...

02:00:18.450 --> 02:00:19.830
They're running out of bullets.

02:00:20.410 --> 02:00:21.410
It. Munn!

02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:22.410
Sir!

02:00:22.700 --> 02:00:23.950
They need more bullets.

02:00:24.450 --> 02:00:25.570
We've been trying, Sir.

02:00:25.780 --> 02:00:27.410
But the Pathans are too many.

02:00:27.790 --> 02:00:29.700
It's impossible to reach Saragarhi.

02:01:39.330 --> 02:01:41.910
Narayan, bring more bullets quickly!

02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:46.780
Go to hell!

02:01:57.910 --> 02:01:59.030
Narayan!

02:05:55.470 --> 02:05:56.290
Sir!

02:05:56.370 --> 02:05:59.260
Two Pathans are trying
to blow up the west wall.

02:06:49.110 --> 02:06:50.690
Everything is over, Sir.

02:06:51.230 --> 02:06:52.770
The wall has fallen, Gurmukh...

02:06:53.230 --> 02:06:54.270
Not us.

02:06:55.070 --> 02:06:57.110
We need to stop them
for some more time.

02:06:58.440 --> 02:06:59.980
Go and take your
position at the Lamp.

02:07:00.270 --> 02:07:03.730
And Chanda Singh,
you stay with Gurmukh.

02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:06.100
But Sir, I...

02:07:06.180 --> 02:07:08.570
This might be my last order,
Chanda Singh.

02:07:11.310 --> 02:07:12.520
Accept it?

02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:19.070
Pass on a message from
me to Lawrence Sir, Gurmukh.

02:07:19.150 --> 02:07:20.150
What, Sir?

02:07:21.900 --> 02:07:23.610
You know it well.

02:07:25.940 --> 02:07:27.150
Yes Sir.

02:07:28.980 --> 02:07:30.860
Fill the flasks, Khuda Daad.

02:07:31.650 --> 02:07:33.320
Our enemies will need it.

02:07:33.400 --> 02:07:34.400
Yes Sir.

02:07:37.610 --> 02:07:39.940
36th Sikh, any doubts?

02:07:40.020 --> 02:07:41.110
No, Sir!

02:07:41.190 --> 02:07:41.910
Any doubts?

02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:43.270
NO SIR!

02:07:47.570 --> 02:07:49.270
Shut the door, Gurmukh!

02:08:10.170 --> 02:08:11.170
Sir.

02:08:11.250 --> 02:08:12.120
Tell me.

02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:15.320
The operator has sent you
a message from Havaldar Ishar Singh.

02:08:16.170 --> 02:08:17.170
What is it?

02:08:17.290 --> 02:08:19.680
"So long, Fakhar."

02:08:24.190 --> 02:08:26.140
Finish off the remaining Sikhs,
quickly.

02:08:29.150 --> 02:08:30.560
There's still time...

02:08:31.230 --> 02:08:33.580
We can conquer Gulistan.

02:08:39.150 --> 02:08:41.320
You won't come back this time,
will you Ishar?

02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:47.570
Who's going to look after your fields?

02:08:49.320 --> 02:08:50.376
You'll be there, won't you?

02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:51.490
And your mother?

02:08:52.230 --> 02:08:54.090
Who'll take care of her, my foot?

02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:55.770
You'll manage.

02:08:56.360 --> 02:08:57.840
I have full trust in you.

02:08:58.270 --> 02:08:59.270
And what about me?

02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:04.270
You're my only support, Ishar.

02:09:09.020 --> 02:09:10.580
So should I leave
the fort and run away?

02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:25.760
Don't let our community down!

02:09:38.230 --> 02:09:40.480
Attack!

02:09:48.290 --> 02:09:52.260

Didn't I tell you,
your turbans would be at our feet?

02:17:58.110 --> 02:18:00.690
Dream on!

02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:08.510
Hold!

02:18:13.750 --> 02:18:15.520
Kill me if you want,

02:18:16.820 --> 02:18:19.060
but don't touch my turban.

02:18:19.390 --> 02:18:21.430
No one will touch your turban.

02:18:22.330 --> 02:18:24.140
I give you my word.

02:18:29.660 --> 02:18:30.760
What's your name?

02:18:34.140 --> 02:18:35.370
Ishar Singh.

02:18:36.190 --> 02:18:38.620
I'll always remember you, Ishar Singh.

02:19:18.250 --> 02:19:22.760
I hope I didn't let us down, my love?

02:20:04.950 --> 02:20:07.260
Stay strong, brother.

02:20:28.200 --> 02:20:30.640
Damn, he sure was one tough nut to crack.

02:20:32.510 --> 02:20:35.510
We've lost the battle and the day,
Gul Badshah.

02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:39.010
It's going to be dark soon.

02:20:40.540 --> 02:20:43.070
It's impossible to reach
Gulistan and Lockhart now.

02:20:44.800 --> 02:20:48.540
I'm not going back
only carrying defeat...

02:20:51.180 --> 02:20:56.200
Do whatever you want, but
do not remove any Sikh's turban.

02:21:06.310 --> 02:21:08.700
I want to hear that Sikh scream.

02:21:10.920 --> 02:21:12.490
Set the tower on fire.

02:23:38.550 --> 02:23:43.450
One shall be forever blessed,
who says God is the ultimate truth!

02:23:43.530 --> 02:23:48.700
One shall be forever blessed,
